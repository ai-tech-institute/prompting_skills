[Your detailed format requirements]
```

### ◇ Why This Works Better:
- Quality requirements are part of the prompt
- AI knows what to include upfront
- Clear standards for content
- Easy to verify output matches requirements

## ◈ 7. Advanced Content Techniques

### ◇ Multi-Format Content:
When you need content for different platforms, request them separately to ensure quality and manage token limits effectively:

```markdown
APPROACH 1 - Request Core Message First:
Create a product announcement for our new AI feature with these key points:
- Main benefit: 10x faster search
- Key feature: AI-powered results
- Target audience: Enterprise teams
- USP: Works with existing data
```

### ❖ Example 1: Creating Platform-Specific Content

After getting your core message, create separate requests:

```markdown
Using this announcement: [paste core message]
Create a LinkedIn post:
- Professional tone
- Max 200 words
- Include key benefit
- End with clear CTA
```

### ◇ Example 2: Multi-Step Content Creation

Step 1 - Core Content:
```markdown
Create a detailed product announcement for our AI search feature:
[Content requirements]
```

Step 2 - Platform Adaptation:
```markdown
Using this announcement: [paste previous output]
Create a Twitter thread:
- Max 4 tweets
- Each tweet self-contained
- Include key benefits
- End with clear CTA
```

### ❖ Why This Works Better:
- Manages token limits realistically
- Ensures quality for each format
- Maintains message consistency
- Allows format-specific optimization

### ◇ Progressive Disclosure:
Revealing information in stages to avoid overwhelming readers. This technique starts with basics and gradually introduces more complex concepts.

```markdown
MODULE 1: Introduction Blocks
- Greeting for new customers
- Greeting for returning customers
- Problem acknowledgment
- Urgent issue response

MODULE 2: Problem-Solving Blocks
- Troubleshooting steps
- How-to instructions
- Account-related fixes
- Billing explanations

MODULE 3: Closing Blocks
- Next steps outline
- Follow-up information
- Contact options
- Thank you messages
```

**Using Modules for Different Scenarios:**

1. **Password Reset Request:**
```markdown
COMBINE:
1. Returning customer greeting
2. Problem acknowledgment
3. Account-related fixes
4. Next steps outline
5. Thank you messages

Result: Complete password reset assistance email
```

2. **Billing Dispute:**
```markdown
COMBINE:
1. Urgent issue response
2. Problem acknowledgment
3. Billing explanations
4. Next steps outline
5. Contact options

   - Version control for updates
   - Document dependencies

3. Using Modules
   - Start with situation assessment
   - Select relevant blocks
   - Customize connection points
   - Review flow and coherence

The key benefit: Write each block once, then mix and match to create personalized, consistent responses for any situation.

### Story-Driven Content:
Using narrative structures to make complex information more engaging and memorable. This approach connects facts through compelling storylines.

```markdown
STORY ELEMENTS:
1. Narrative Arc
