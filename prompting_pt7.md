━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## ◈ 1. Understanding Data Analysis Prompts

Data analysis prompts need to be specific and structured to get meaningful insights. The key is to guide the AI through the analysis process step by step.

### ◇ Why Structured Analysis Matters:
- Ensures data quality
- Maintains analysis focus
- Produces reliable insights
- Enables clear reporting
- Facilitates decision-making

## ◆ 2. Data Preparation Techniques

When preparing data for analysis, follow these steps to build your prompt:

STEP 1: Initial Assessment
```markdown
Please review this dataset and tell me:
1. What type of data we have (numerical, categorical, time-series)
2. Any obvious quality issues you notice
3. What kind of preparation would be needed for analysis
```

STEP 2: Build Cleaning Prompt
Based on AI's response, create a cleaning prompt:
```markdown
Clean this dataset by:
1. Handling missing values:
   - Remove or fill nulls
   - Explain your chosen method
   - Note any patterns in missing data

2. Fixing data types:
   - Convert dates to proper format
   - Ensure numbers are numerical
   - Standardize text fields

3. Addressing outliers:
   - Identify unusual values
   - Explain why they're outliers
   - Recommend handling method
```

STEP 3: Create Preparation Prompt
After cleaning, structure the preparation:
```markdown
Please prepare this clean data by:
1. Creating new features:
   - Calculate monthly totals
   - Add growth percentages
   - Generate categories

2. Grouping data:
   - By time period
   - By category
   - By relevant segments

3. Adding context:
   - Running averages
   - Benchmarks
   - Rankings
```

### ❖ WHY EACH STEP MATTERS:
- Assessment: Prevents wrong assumptions

Advanced analysis looks beyond basic patterns to find deeper insights. Think of it like being a detective - you're looking for clues and connections that aren't immediately obvious.

### ◇ Correlation Analysis:
This technique helps you understand how different things are connected. For example, does weather affect your sales? Do certain products sell better together?

```markdown
Analyse relationships between variables:

1. Primary Correlations
   Example: Sales vs Weather
   - Is there a direct relationship?
   - How strong is the connection?
   - Is it positive or negative?

2. Secondary Effects
   Example: Weather → Foot Traffic → Sales
   - What factors connect these variables?
   - Are there hidden influences?
   - What else might be involved?

3. Causation Indicators
   - What evidence suggests cause/effect?
   - What other explanations exist?
   - How certain are we?
```

### ❖ Segmentation Analysis:
This helps you group similar things together to find patterns. Like sorting customers into groups based on their behavior.

```markdown
Segment this data using:

CRITERIA:
1. Primary Segments
   Example: Customer Groups
   - High-value (>$1000/month)
   - Medium-value ($500-1000/month)
   - Low-value (<$500/month)

2. Sub-Segments
   Within each group, analyse:
   - Shopping frequency
   - Product preferences
   - Response to promotions

OUTPUTS:
